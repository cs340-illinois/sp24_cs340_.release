    The Microbe is so very small<br>
    You cannot make him out at all,<br>
    But many sanguine people hope<br>
    To see him through a microscope.<br>
    His jointed tongue that lies beneath<br>
    A hundred curious rows of teeth;<br>
    His seven tufted tails with lots<br>
    Of lovely pink and purple spots,<br>

    <div class="poem">
    On each of which a pattern stands,<br>
    Composed of forty separate bands;<br>
    His eyebrows of a tender green;<br>
    All these have never yet been seen—<br>
    But Scientists, who ought to know,<br>
    Assure us that they must be so….<br>
    Oh! let us never, never doubt<br>
    What nobody is sure about!<br>
